Thanks to **{ricordati di mettere il nome degli architetti}** for hosting the 2024 meetup in their studios. The location easy to reach with public transportation, near bus stops, Porta Nuova Train Station and Metro.

# HOW
#### Tickets available [HERE](https://www.khor.store)

Each ticket grants entrance to the venue, badge, stickers and a spot for a **maximum of 3 keyboards**.<br>
Why it's not free? Since the space is not large enough to accomodate an indefinite number of attendees we wanted to be prepared, a limited number of **50** tickets are available for purchase and we wanted to be sure as much attendees as possible are the actual ones interested to be part of this event.<br>
The cost of the ticket will cover all the expenses needed to make this event as pleasant as possible for everyone.

# RULES

- A ticket is required for each attendee.
- Reselling tickets is not allowed, an ID is needed to validate yourself at the entrance.
- If you're bringing your keyboards with you, please respect the 3 units limit so that everyone has space for it.
- No food is allowed inside the venue so that no keyboard will suffer from crumbs. We'll have a drink after the meetup, promise.
- Respect other's property, each keyboard will have a label that tells you if you can touch, grab or only look at it. Follow the label.
- It's from the community for the community, respect each other and have fun.
